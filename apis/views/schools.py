                    - Payload data must be contained `first_name`, `last_name`, `subject_title` and `score`.
                        - `first_name` in payload must be string (if not return bad request status).
                        - `last_name` in payload must be string (if not return bad request status).

                    - Student's score of each subject must be unique (it's mean 1 student only have 1 row of score
                            of each subject).
                    - If student's score of each subject already existed, It will update new score

                    - If Update, Credit must not be changed.
                    - If Data Payload not complete return clearly message with bad request status.
                    - If Subject's Name or Student's Name not found in Database return clearly message with bad request status.
                    - If Success return student's details, subject's title, credit and score context with created status.

        remark:     - `score` is subject's score of each student.
                    - `credit` is subject's credit.
